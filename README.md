<h4 align="center"> Summary:  </h4>

Using a dataset about loan transactions from 2009 to 2017 on the P2P platform Prosper, we set out to compare the 3 types of classifiers & their performance at performing a binary classification of whether a potential lender, based on the loan request issued, is either likely or unlikely to repay the loan.
